# D-Top
Simple but functional rendering of Webtop built on the Documentum D2 platform

It bothers me that out-of-the-box, D2 does NOTHING.  In an effort to help validate D2 v4.5 installations and provide a test environment for my DQL Editor widget, I developed a simple “starter” application that I named “D-Top”.  D-Top provides simple, unrestricted navigation of a Docbase, shows default dm_sysobject properties, versions, audit trails, renditions, object locations, and workflow tasks.  It provides search capabilities, virtual document support, and bookmarks for checked out objects and subscribed objects.  You can create and import documents, as well as check them in and out.  Nothing has been “customized” for specific users, roles, object types, ACLs, or lifecycles.

If you are interested in the “D-Top” D2 starter project, you can download it here.  Once downloaded, import it into D2-Config like you would import any other D2 configuration.  See the EMC Documentum D2 v4.5 Administration Guide for instructions regarding importing D2 configurations.
